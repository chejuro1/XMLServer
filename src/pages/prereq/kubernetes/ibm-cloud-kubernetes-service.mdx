## What is IKS?

The IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS) provides an isolated and secure platform for managing containers.

As a certified Kubernetes provider, IBM's Managed Kubernetes provides intelligent scheduling, self-healing, horizontal scaling, service discovery and load balancing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management.
The Kubernetes service also has advanced capabilities around simplified cluster management, container security and isolation policies, the ability to design your own cluster, and integrated operational tools for consistency in deployment.

This highly secure environment for production workloads has built-in container-level security, including isolation policies, CIS-hardened infrastructure and broad industry compliance (including PCI, HIPPA-ready, SOC1, SOC2 and more).

For more details, see [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service).
