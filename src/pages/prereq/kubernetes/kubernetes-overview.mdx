## Kubernetes

Kubernetes (which is also referred to as "K8s" and is described at a high-level on the [Kubernetes home page](https://kubernetes.io/)) is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
You will use the command-line tool, `kubectl`, extensively when you follow the steps that are described in this runbook. The `kubectl` download and installation steps are described on [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

Minikube is a variant of Kubernetes that runs a single-node cluster inside a virtual machine (VM) on your laptop. See [Minikube](/prereq/kubernetes/minikube) for the configuration details for IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM).

## Kubernetes supported version skew

For information to the Kubernetes version and version skew support policy see [Kubernetes version and version skew support policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).

Some examples are outlined as follows.

### kube-apiserver

In highly-available (HA) clusters, the newest and oldest `kube-apiserver` instances must be within one minor version.

Example:

* newest `kube-apiserver` is at __1.19__
* other `kube-apiserver` instances are supported at __1.19__ and __1.18__

### kubelet

`kubelet` must not be newer than `kube-apiserver`, and may be up to two minor versions older.

Example:

* `kube-apiserver` is at __1.19__
* `kubelet` is supported at __1.19__, __1.18__, and __1.17__

**Note:** If version skew exists between `kube-apiserver` instances in an HA cluster, this narrows the allowed `kubelet` versions.

Example:

* `kube-apiserver` instances are at __1.19__ and __1.18__
* `kubelet` is supported at __1.18__, and __1.17__ (__1.19__ is not supported because that would be newer than the `kube-apiserver` instance at version 1.18)
