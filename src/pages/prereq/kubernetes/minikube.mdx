Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a virtual machine (VM) on your laptop, for users who want to try out Kubernetes or develop with it.
Minikube documentation is available at [Installing Kubernetes with Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
The following sections are not a substitute for the official documentation but they get you started in a classic configuration.

The following installation steps are described:

* Installing Minikube
* Setting up the Docker® registry
* Configuring the hosts file for Minikube
* Starting Minikube
* Enabling Helm for Minikube
* A summary of some useful Minikube commands

## Minikube installation

Minikube installation steps are described in the official documentation for your preferred Operating System: [Install Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

## Starting Minikube

<InlineNotification kind="info">

**Note:** In the following example we set the `--insecure-registry` option passing in a subnet of `192.168.0.0/16`.
The IP address on your machine _may_ not be on the appropriate network for this subnet to work.
Therefore, start a Minikube instance to verify the IP address begins with 192.168.0.X. You need only do this once.
See the note in [Specifying the insecure registry](#specifying-the-insecure-registry).

</InlineNotification>

Minikube can be started with a command as simple as `minikube start` without any additional parameters. However, the resulting VM will be too small to deploy an instance of IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM),
so several other parameters are required:

```shell
minikube start --driver=virtualbox --cpus 4 --memory 8G \
               --insecure-registry "192.168.0.0/16" \
               --disk-size='30G' \
               --kubernetes-version v1.19.12
```

### Specifying the resource allocation

You can add properties to specify the resource allocation. For example:

* `--cpus 4` to use 4 CPUs
* `--memory 8G` to use 8 GB of RAM
* `--disk-size=30G` to use 30 GB of disk space

### Specifying the VM driver

Add the `--driver=` option to the `minikube start` command to specify the underlying virtual machine driver. The following drivers were tested:

* [VirtualBox](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/virtualbox/) (`virtualbox`) on OSX, Linux, and Windows
* [VMware Fusion](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/vmware/) (`vmware`) on OSX
  * **Note**: There is an [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/9720) running Minikube on macOS Big Sur with VMware Fusion 12. If you are using Big Sur, use an alternative driver.
* [Docker](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/kvm2/) (`docker`) on Linux
* [KVM](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/kvm2/) (`kvm2`) on Linux

The [Install Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) page gives you more information on available VM driver options.

### Specifying the insecure registry

You must specify the `--insecure-registry` option to reference the Docker registry that is created. The `--insecure-registry` value is the same as specified in the  `daemon.json` file.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** Because of a limitation in the current version of Minikube, adding the `--insecure-registry` option works on a new Minikube instance only.
If you start Minikube, be sure to run `minikube stop` and `minikube delete` before you start it again with the `--insecure-registry` option.

</InlineNotification>

### Specifying the Kubernetes version

You can override the version of Kubernetes that gets installed inside the Minikube VM by using the `--kubernetes-version` flag. This flag controls the compatibility between the client tools and the Kubernetes specification.

If you override the Kubernetes version, ensure that you download and install the corresponding version of `kubectl` - this version must be the same version as the Kubernetes cluster.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The `kubectl` version running locally and on Minikube should be compatible, so it's possible to use the `--kubernetes-version` flag to keep them consistent.

## Docker Hub download rate limit and Minikube

In November 2020, Docker introduced [download rate limits](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/) on Docker Hub.
Normally, this can be mitigated by providing an Image Pull Secret to the deployment.

For Minikube addons these pull secrets are not exposed, so the solution involves providing a `config.json` file containing the credentials to the Kubelet process running inside the Minikube environment.

1. Authenticate your local Docker client with Docker Hub: `docker login`
    * You can register for a free account on the [Docker Hub website](https://hub.docker.com/signup)
2. Copy the contents of your local Docker secrets:

    ```shell
    cat ~/.docker/config.json && echo
    ```

    * The output should look something like below:

    ```json
    {
      "auths": {
        "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
          "auth": "<base64 of username:password>"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. Open a terminal in your Minikube VM:

    ```shell
    minikube ssh
    ```

4. Paste the contents of the file from step 2 into `/var/lib/kubelet/config.json`:

    * Edit the command to include the contents of your `config.json` file first

    ```shell
    cat << EOS | sudo tee /var/lib/kubelet/config.json
    {
      "auths": {
        "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
          "auth": "<base64 of username:password>"
        }
      }
    }
    EOS
    ```

5. Restart the `kubelet` process in the Minikube VM:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart kubelet
    ```

6. Exit the Minikube terminal.

## Docker registry

You need a registry to use docker images with Helm in Minikube.
There are different types of registries that can be used. However, this page describes a simple registry option that doesn't require extra components.

Minikube provides an add-on to run a registry in a container. For more information, see [How to access the Docker registry within minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/docker_registry/).

You can use the following command to enable the add-on:

```shell
minikube addons enable registry
```

When enabled, starting Minikube starts two pods on the `kube-system` namespace, named `registry` and `registry-proxy`. Now the registry is active and can be used. The registry points to the Minikube IP address on port 5000.

The containers don't mount any volumes, so stopping Minikube deletes the registry content.

## Hostname configuration for Minikube

This runbook uses a generic hostname of `minikube.local` as an example in commands and the configuration files.
You should add the Minikube IP address to the `hosts` file by using the generic hostname, or else modify the usage of `minikube.local` in this runbook to reflect your local hostname.

Specifying `minikube ip` in the following command returns the Minikube VM's IP address that is accessible from your workstation:

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Mac/Linux">
<Row>
<Column>

```shell
echo -e "$(minikube ip)\tminikube.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

</Column>
</Row>
</Tab>

<Tab label="Windows">
<Row>
<Column>

```powershell
Add-Content -Path C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts -Value "$(minikube ip)`tminikube.local" -Force
```

</Column>
</Row>
</Tab>

</Tabs>

The local Docker client configuration must be also be updated with the corresponding IP address.

* Update the `daemon.json` docker configuration file with the Minikube IP address. This file is usually located in:
  * `~/.docker/daemon.json` on OSX
  * `/etc/docker/daemon.json` on Linux
  * `C:\ProgramData\Docker\config\daemon.json` on Windows
* Restart the Docker daemon:
  * On Linux - run: `sudo systemctl restart docker`
  * On Mac and Windows - use the "Restart Docker" menu option in the Docker Desktop application.

Example of `daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "insecure-registries": [
    "192.168.0.0/16"
  ]
}
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** You can provide a specific IP address, or specify a subnet to future-proof the Docker client configuration.

</InlineNotification>

The Minikube IP address might change when you run `minikube delete`. If it changes, you must repeat these steps.

Therefore, reconfirm the Minikube IP and its setting in the `hosts` file every time you start Minikube, or after you run `minikube delete`.

## Minikube Ingress

Ingress is a reverse proxy, which sits in front of the application that is deployed in Kubernetes. It facilitates use of a custom domain name to access a deployed application, instead of using service ports.
To enable Ingress for Minikube, you must enable the `ingress` add-on.

```shell
minikube addons enable ingress
```

## Create a namespace

Create a namespace for the SPM deployment, again use an environment variable for your convenience when following the guide.

Create the environment variable, you can set to value to anything you like, but it should consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or `-`, and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. `my-name`,  or `123-abc`):

```shell
export PROJECT="dev"
```

Create the namespace:

```shell
kubectl create namespace $PROJECT
```

Switch to the new namespace:

```shell
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace $PROJECT
```

## Useful Minikube commands

Some useful Minikube commands are as follows:

```shell
# Sample commands
minikube status       # See if Minikube is running
minikube start        # Create and start Minikube
minikube dashboard    # Access the Kubernetes dashboard running within the Minikube cluster
