OpenShift is a family of containerisation software products developed by RedHat. It's flagship product, OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), can be used to
configure and deploy IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM). More information about OCP can be found [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/welcome/index.html).

CodeReady Containers (CRC) is a minimal cluster that is designed to run on your local workstation as a development environment for OpenShift. Steps to deploy
SPM using CRC can be found in the [CodeReady Containers tab](/prereq/openshift/codeready-containers). Further information can be found in the [official CRC repository](https://github.com/code-ready/crc).
