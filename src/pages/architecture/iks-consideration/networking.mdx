## Networking

[Network Policies](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-network_policies) in kubernetes in IKS are used to determine object communication.
They can be implemented using [Cluster Networking](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters) or [Ingress](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ingress).

Ingress works by exposing services internal to the cluster via external endpoints. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.
