## Storage

Before you get started with provisioning storage, it is important to understand the Kubernetes concepts of a `PersistentVolume` (PV) and a `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) and how they work together in a cluster.

Information for this can be found here at [Understanding Kubernetes storage basics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#pvc_pv) on the IBM Cloud site.
