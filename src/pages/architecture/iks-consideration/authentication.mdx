## Authentication

All IKS clusters have two categories of users: service accounts managed by IKS, and normal users.

IKS uses client certificates, bearer tokens, an authenticating proxy, or HTTP basic auth to authenticate API requests through authentication plugins.

Information about [Authenticating](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/kubernetes) can be found within the link.
