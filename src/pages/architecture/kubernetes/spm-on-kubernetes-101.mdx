If this is your first time looking into the topic of IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) on Kubernetes, this is the right place to start.

Now, before moving forward on the specifics, take a look at the videos available in this section to familiarise yourself with the main concepts of a containerised architecture on Kubernetes.

The first thing you need to know is that SPM introduced five new mandatory technologies to deploy on Kubernetes.

| Technology | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Cloud Kubernetes Services  | Highly scalable platform to orchestrate containerised applications on IBM Cloud. |
| Red Hat OpenShift  | Highly scalable platform to orchestrate containerised applications on any environment supported by Red Hat. |
| WebSphere Liberty | SPM Application Server for cloud native architectures on Kubernetes. |
| Helm | Consistently deploy containerised applications into Kubernetes. |
| Docker | Package SPM into containers for seamless environment portability. |
| IBM MQ | Enterprise-grade messaging engine to move JMS messages for SPM on cloud native architectures. |

**Note:** These are mandatory technologies and cannot be used independently from each other for SPM.
