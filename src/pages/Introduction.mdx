IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) was enhanced in version 7.0.10.0 to enable it to be deployed on cloud native hosting platforms.
While SPM could be cloud hosted in a IaaS cloud delivery model, this model cannot leverage the benefits of flexibility, elasticity, efficiency
and the strategic value that is offered by cloud native architecture.

SPM was further enhanced in 7.0.11.0 to support RedHat OpenShift Container Platform.

Since version 7.0.11.0 SPM supports Red Hat OpenShift, and this runbook describes how to use CodeReady Containers (CRC) for development purposes.

This **Runbook** is a guide (not a pre-requisite), a starter pack to help engineering teams in onboarding IBM® Cúram SPM on Kubernetes.

The associated **Helm Charts** and **Dockerfiles** provided with the runbook in Github are a suggested starting point, specially if you are not familiar with the architecture and constructs referred in the **Runbook**.
Although Helm and Docker are mandatory technologies (see [Prerequisite software](/prereq/prereq)), engineering teams are free to develop **Helm Charts** or **Dockerfiles** according to their own needs,
either by changing/extending/customising our samples provided in Github or by creating their own from scratch.
