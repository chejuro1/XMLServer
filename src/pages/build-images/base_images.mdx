title: Building base images
description: Building base images from source
---

Some of the images built in the next section, [Building the Docker® images](/build-images/build_images) require authentication with the Red Hat Container Registry.

If you do not have an active Red Hat Subscription you will need to build these images from source instead. If you do have an appropriate subscription, you do not need to build from source, please continue to [Building the Docker® image](/build-images/build_images).

<InlineNotification>

Access to the [Red Hat Container Registry](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search) is also available through the [Red Hat Developer Subscription](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/getting-red-hat-developer-subscription-what-rhel-users-need-know).

</InlineNotification>

If you do need to build from source, you can do so with the following steps.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

If you are building these images on macOS with Docker Desktop for Mac version 3.2 or later, an extra environment variable must be set to disable the BuildKit feature, as it prevents successful builds of the S2I images below:

```shell
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0
```

## IBM® SDK, Java™ Technology Edition

* Clone repository and change into the working directory:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/ibmruntimes/ci.docker.git
  cd ci.docker/ibmjava/tests
  ```

* Build image:

  ```shell
  ./build.sh ibm/ibmjava8-sdk-ubi8-minimal:latest ../8/sdk/ubi-min
  ```

## S2I Core (required for Apache HTTP Server)

* Install prerequisite packages:
  * Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install go-md2man make`
  * CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install go-md2man make`
    * `go-md2man` is available in the following repositories:
      * [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server - Optional](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3418891)
      * [Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL)
    * `go-md2man` can also be installed as a Go package

      ```shell
      go get github.com/cpuguy83/go-md2man
      export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
      ```

  * MacOS: `brew install bash coreutils go-md2man`
    * Reopen the terminal after installing these packages
    * Update the `PATH` variable to use the GNU version of commands that also exist on MacOS:

      ```shell
      export PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
      ```

* Clone repository and change into the working directory:

  ```shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-base-container.git
  cd s2i-base-container
  ```

* Build image:

  ```shell
  make build TARGET=rhel8 VERSIONS=core
  ```

## Apache HTTP Server

* Clone repository and change into the working directory:

  ```shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/sclorg/httpd-container.git
  cd httpd-container
  ```

* Build image:

  ```shell
  make tag TARGET=rhel8 VERSIONS=2.4
