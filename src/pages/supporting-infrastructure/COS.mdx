### What is IBM Cloud Object Storage?

IBM® Cloud&trade; Object Storage (COS) makes it possible to store practically limitless amounts of data, simply and cost effectively.
It is commonly used for data archiving and backup; for web and mobile applications; and as scalable, persistent storage for analytics.
Flexible storage class tiers with a policy-based archive let you effectively manage costs while meeting data access needs.
The integrated IBM Aspera® high-speed data transfer option makes it easy to transfer data to and from IBM Cloud Object Storage, and query-in-place functionality allows you to run analytics directly on your data.

For more information about Cloud Object Storage, see [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage).

### Usage

To archive data persistently through COS, prepare the following prerequisites in the Kubernetes cluster:

* Create a bucket in the COS service by following the [Getting Started guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started)
* Take note of the `bucket-name`, `access-key`, `secret-key` and `service-private-endpoint` for the bucket
* Install the COS Plugin into your cluster by following [Storing data on IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-object_storage)
* Enable persistence by toggling the following properties in the override values file injected through Helm during deployment:

```yaml path=override-values.yaml

global:
  apps:
    common:
      persistence:
        # Persistence volume to store data (such as non-log files)
        enabled: true
        # If enabled, creates a PVC to connect to IBM Cloud Object Storage
        # Properties storageClassName, secretKey, accessKey, instanceId, and bucketName are required
        # Values available in the WebUI where the bucket was pre-created
        storageClassName: "storage-class-name"
        instanceId: "<instance-id>"
        bucketName: "<bucket-name>"
        accessKey: "<access-key>"
        secretKey: "<secret-key>"
        bucketEndpoint: "<service-private-endpoint>"
        mountPoint: "/tmp/persistence"
        subDir: "/folder/name"
```
