The Kubernetes object that is being created by using the code in this repository is a CronJob, which is scheduled to run every 30 minutes.
Therefore, initially no pod is listed, but a pod is started after 30 minutes and is visible when you run the `kubectl get pods` command.

The schedule can be adjusted using the `batch.programs.queued.schedule` key.

The pod runs the standard command `build.sh runbatch` that is described in [Running the Batch Launcher](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=launcher-running-batch).

At the end of the execution, the pod stops but is not destroyed and a new pod is created after another 30 minutes. Access the log by running the `kubectl logs pod/podname` command.

You can delete the pod by running the `kubectl delete pod/podname` command.
